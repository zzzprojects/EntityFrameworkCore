# Transaction

## Introduction

In Entity Framework, when you call SaveChanges() to insert, delete, or update data to the database, the entity framework will wrap that operation in a transaction.

 - Transactions allow several database operations to be processed in an atomic manner. 
 - If the transaction is committed, all of the operations are successfully applied to the database. 
 - If the transaction is rolled back, none of the operations are applied to the database.

In EF 6 and EF Core, you can use multiple SaveChanges within a single transaction. You can use the `DbContext.Database` API to begin, commit, and rollback transactions. 

The following example shows two SaveChanges() operations and a LINQ query being executed in a single transaction.


```csharp
using (var context = new MyContext())
{
    using (var transaction = context.Database.BeginTransaction())
    {
        try
        {
            var customer = context.Customers
                .Where(c => c.CustomerId == 2)
                .FirstOrDefault();
                customer.Address = "43 rue St. Laurent";

            context.SaveChanges();
             
            var newCustomer = new Customer
            {
                FirstName = "Elizabeth",
                LastName = "Lincoln",
                Address = "23 Tsawassen Blvd."
            };
             
            context.Customers.Add(newCustomer);
            context.SaveChanges();

            transaction.Commit();
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            transaction.Rollback();
        }
    }
}
```
